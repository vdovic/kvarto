  <p class="lead">
    Lexicon Coach turns a simple Google Sheet into a personal language laboratory. Collect new English words
    and phrases in your spreadsheet and synchronise them here to review, search and study.
  </p>

  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a Google Sheet with columns for the word or phrase, its translation, and any examples or notes.</li>
    <li>Publish the sheet to the web or copy the CSV export link.</li>
    <li>Paste the link into the sync form on the home page.</li>
    <li>Use the study mode to practise flashcards generated from your latest entries.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep each row focused on one vocabulary item. Use the notes field for collocations, synonyms or grammar reminders.</li>
    <li>Update the spreadsheet any time during the day—syncing is as simple as pressing the “Sync now” button.</li>
    <li>For longer explanations, paste a short summary in the notes field so the flashcard stays concise.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you ever need to adjust the column names in the sheet, use the “Advanced column mapping” section on the sync form.</p>
